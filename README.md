# Nova Package Development
A forum for talking about the process of Nova Package Development... use GitHub issues almost like they were StackOverflow.

You may find it useful to use the `novacli` tool to help create a new Nova package, or the Nova Skeleton by Spatie.

## Questions
- **Why here?**  
    It's public, searchable, everyone already has accounts, it's zero cost to set up, and you get free image uploads and markdown parsing.
- **Is this just for people who are distributing their packages on Packagist?**  
    Nope! Even if you're just writing packages for single use, this is still a fine place for chatting about it.
- **Lists should have three items.**  
    I agree!
